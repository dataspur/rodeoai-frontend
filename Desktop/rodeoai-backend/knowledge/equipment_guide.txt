TEAM ROPING EQUIPMENT GUIDE

Selecting the right equipment is crucial for success and safety in team roping. This guide covers essential gear for both horse and rider.

ROPES

Header Ropes:
Headers typically use ropes between 30-35 feet in length. The rope should be stiff enough to maintain loop shape but flexible enough for smooth handling.

Materials:
- Nylon: Durable, consistent, good in wet conditions
- Poly-nylon blend: Popular choice, good feel and durability
- Grass (natural fiber): Traditional, requires more maintenance

Diameter: Most headers prefer 3/8" or 7/16" diameter. Larger diameters provide more weight for windy conditions but can be harder to handle.

Heeler Ropes:
Heeler ropes are generally longer (35-40 feet) to allow for greater distance from the steer. The extra length helps create the larger, flatter loop needed for catching hind legs.

Characteristics: Heeler ropes should be softer and more flexible than header ropes to lay flat on the ground. Many heelers prefer a slightly smaller diameter (5/16" to 3/8") for better feel and control.

Rope Maintenance:
- Store ropes coiled and hanging to maintain shape
- Keep ropes clean and free from dirt
- Condition ropes periodically with rope dressing
- Replace worn or damaged ropes immediately
- Break in new ropes gradually before competition

SADDLES

Team roping saddles are specifically designed for the demands of this event. Key features include:

Construction: Roping saddles are built on a strong tree (frame) to withstand the force of catching and holding cattle. They're heavier and more substantial than other western saddles.

Horn: The saddle horn is tall, thick, and wrapped with rubber or rawhide for secure dallying. It must be strong enough to hold a steer under tension. Most roping saddles have a 3" to 4" horn cap.

Rigging: Full double rigging (front and back cinches) distributes force and keeps the saddle stable. The front cinch should be snug, while the back cinch prevents the saddle from tipping forward during catches.

Seat: Roping saddles typically have a flatter seat than other styles, allowing riders to move quickly and maintain balance during fast maneuvers.

Stirrups: Wide stirrups with leather or rubber treads provide a stable platform. Many ropers prefer oxbow stirrups for security.

Popular Brands: Cactus, Billy Cook, Martin Saddlery, and Circle Y are well-respected roping saddle manufacturers.

PROTECTIVE GEAR

Leg Protection for Horses:
- Splint boots (front legs): Protect cannon bones and tendons
- Skid boots (hind legs): Protect fetlocks during stops and turns
- Bell boots: Protect coronary bands and heels
- Polo wraps: Alternative to boots, provide support and protection

Proper fit is essential - boots that are too tight restrict circulation, while loose boots can slip and cause injury.

Rider Safety Gear:
- Helmet: Increasingly common and highly recommended
- Protective vest: Provides torso protection in case of falls
- Gloves: Protect hands during roping and improve grip
- Boots: Sturdy western boots with heels prevent foot from slipping through stirrup

BITS AND HEADSTALLS

Header Horses:
Headers often use bits that provide good control for rating and turning. Common choices include:
- Snaffle bits: Good for training and young horses
- Shanked bits: Provide leverage for more experienced horses
- Combination bits: Offer versatility

The bit should match the horse's training level and mouth sensitivity. Communication is more important than severity.

Heeler Horses:
Heelers often prefer bits that allow quick responses for positioning and backing. Many use similar bits to headers, though some prefer less severe bits since heeler horses don't need to make sharp turns.

Headstall Considerations:
- Proper fit prevents rubbing and discomfort
- Browband or one-ear styles are both popular
- Quality leather lasts longer and is safer
- Regular maintenance keeps leather supple

ROPES BAGS AND ACCESSORIES

Organization:
- Rope bags keep ropes clean, organized, and protected
- Separate compartments for multiple ropes
- Weather-resistant materials
- Easy access design for quick rope changes

Additional Accessories:
- Rope dressing/conditioner
- Hondo (honda) replacements
- Extra leather strings for dallying practice
- Measuring tape for rope length verification

HORSE TACK MAINTENANCE

Regular maintenance extends equipment life and ensures safety:

Daily:
- Check all tack for wear or damage before riding
- Clean bits after each use
- Remove dirt and sweat from saddle and pads

Weekly:
- Deep clean leather with saddle soap
- Check cinch hardware and billets
- Inspect boots and wraps for damage

Monthly:
- Condition leather with quality oil or conditioner
- Check saddle tree for cracks or damage
- Inspect and replace worn pad liners

BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Starting Out:
Beginners can start with quality used equipment to reduce initial costs. Focus on:
- Safe, properly fitting saddle
- Appropriate rope for your position
- Basic protective gear for horse

As You Progress:
Invest in better equipment gradually:
- Custom or semi-custom saddle fitted to you and your horse
- Multiple ropes for different conditions
- Higher-quality protective gear
- Backup equipment for competitions

Professional Level:
Serious competitors often have:
- Multiple saddles for different horses
- Extensive rope selection (10+ ropes)
- Complete backup sets of all equipment
- Custom-made or high-end gear throughout

BUYING TIPS

When purchasing equipment:
- Try before you buy when possible
- Buy from reputable dealers or established ropers
- Don't compromise on safety-critical items
- Ask experienced ropers for recommendations
- Consider resale value for expensive items
- Start with quality basics rather than cheap everything

EQUIPMENT CHECKLIST FOR PRACTICE

Essential Items:
□ Saddle with appropriate rigging
□ Saddle pad/blanket
□ Front and rear cinches
□ Breast collar
□ Bridle with appropriate bit
□ At least 2 practice ropes
